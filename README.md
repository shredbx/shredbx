# ShredBX Monorepo v0.0.1

## What & Why

This monorepo is the **open-source workspace** for ShredBX experiments and projects.  
Its purpose is to collect, document, and evolve reusable solutions in one place, making them accessible across apps, packages, and external projects.

At the core is the **PatternBook methodology**, which turns real code into discoverable, reusable knowledge for both humans and AI.

## When to Use

- To explore ShredBX’s open-source experiments
- To reuse modular solutions across projects
- To learn from documented examples and patterns
- To contribute new patterns or improvements

## When Not to Use

- For closed, proprietary projects
- For isolated experiments that don’t benefit from shared context

## How It Works

- **Packages** contain reusable building blocks (e.g., ReactBook, PatternBook)
- **Apps** provide interfaces, demos, and workspaces (e.g., web portals)
- Documentation is kept next to the source (code + docs together)
- Everything is indexed and structured to be discoverable by AI and humans

## Examples / Use-cases

- Browsing React patterns through ReactBook-Web
- Sharing Zustand slice patterns across web and native apps
- Using the repo as a reference for modular, scalable solutions
