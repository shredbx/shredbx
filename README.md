# ShredBX Monorepo

This repository is the **workspace for ShredBX experiments and development**.  
It serves as a single place to organize, document, and evolve reusable patterns, tools, and projects.

## Purpose

The goal of this monorepo is to build a **living knowledge base of proven solutions**.  
Everything developed here is intended to be modular, composable, and reusable across projects.

## PatternBook

At the core of this monorepo is the **PatternBook**:

- A methodology for capturing solutions as reusable patterns
- A documentation-first approach that makes knowledge discoverable by both humans and AI
- A way to keep development consistent, efficient, and scalable

Think of PatternBook as a **recipe book**: solutions are written once, documented clearly, and reused everywhere.

ðŸ‘‰ See [PatternBook documentation](./src/packages/patternbook/README.md) for details.
