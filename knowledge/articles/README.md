## Article Format

Each article follows this structure:

1. **Context** - The situation that led to the decision/learning
2. **Problem** - What challenge was being solved
3. **Solution** - The approach taken and why
4. **Implementation** - Technical details and code examples
5. **Results** - Outcomes and measurements
6. **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways and insights
7. **Recommendations** - Best practices for similar situations
8. **Related Resources** - Links to relevant use cases and documentation

## Contributing Guidelines

When adding new articles:

- Focus on the "why" behind decisions, not just the "how"
- Include concrete examples and code snippets
- Document both successes and failures
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Reference related use cases and documentation
- Use clear, narrative structure that tells a story

## Target Audience

These articles are written for:

- **Future Team Members** - Understanding architectural decisions
- **LLM Assistants** - Context for making similar decisions
- **Other Development Teams** - Learning from our experiences
- **Ourselves** - Remembering why we made certain choices
