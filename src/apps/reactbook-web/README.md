# @reactbook/web v0.0.1

## What & Why

This is the **main ReactBook web application**.  
It serves as the **experimental lab workspace** â€” a control center where all ReactBook projects, demos, and knowledge bases can be explored.

## When to Use

- To browse and test all ReactBook experiments in one place
- To connect ReactBook, PatternBook, and other packages into a single workspace
- To prototype and run demos quickly

## When Not to Use

- If you only need a specific package (ReactBook, PatternBook) without the full lab
- For production apps with end-user focus (this is an internal lab)

## How It Works

- Built with **Next.js** as the frontend framework
- Integrates ReactBook packages (ReactBook, PatternBook, MCP tools)
- Provides a UI to navigate, run, and combine experiments

## Examples / Use-cases

- Running a React pattern demo in-browser
- Viewing live documentation from PatternBook
- Prototyping cross-package experiments in one interface
