# @shredbx/web v0.0.1

## What & Why

This is the **main ShredBX web application**.  
It serves as the **experimental dev lab workspace** â€” a control center where all ShredBX projects, demos, and knowledge bases can be explored.

## When to Use

- To browse and test all ShredBX experiments in one place
- To connect ReactBook, PatternBook, and other packages into a single workspace
- To prototype and run demos quickly

## When Not to Use

- If you only need a specific package (ReactBook, PatternBook) without the full lab
- For production apps with end-user focus (this is an internal lab)

## How It Works

- Built with **Next.js** as the frontend framework
- Integrates ShredBX packages (ReactBook, PatternBook, MCP tools)
- Provides a UI to navigate, run, and combine experiments

## Examples / Use-cases

- Running a React pattern demo in-browser
- Viewing live documentation from PatternBook
- Prototyping cross-package experiments in one interface
