# PatternBook

## What & Why

PatternBook is a clear, reusable guide to solving problems. It captures solutions once and makes them available for reuse both across projects and inside a single project â€” saving time, avoiding mistakes, and supporting consistent refactoring and scalability. It also serves as a source of truth for AI assistants: making them context-friendly by prioritizing your proven solutions over generic ones from the web.

## When to Use

- To avoid reinventing the wheel.
- To keep work consistent, maintainable, and scalable across a growing codebase.
- To reuse solutions inside the same project, supporting faster refactoring.
- To guide AI assistants so they follow your way of solving problems.

## When Not to Use

- When the solution is untested or experimental.
- When documenting costs more than its reuse value.

## Notes

- Every pattern must include these sections: What & Why, When to Use, When Not to Use, Notes, References.
- Patterns may be small (a logic slice) or large (a full feature).
- Patterns can stand alone or combine into bigger solutions.
- This README is the first example pattern, showing the required structure.
- Practical examples will be added to each pattern for clarity.
- For humans, PatternBook makes solutions easier to share and apply. For AI, it provides context-friendly guidance.

## References

- Reference Example: this README demonstrates the "PatternBook README format."
- Future patterns should link back here to show they follow the same structure.
