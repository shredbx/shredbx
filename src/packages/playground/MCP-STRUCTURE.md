# MCP Structure Overview

## What Was Accomplished

The playground package has been restructured to properly separate MCP server and client functionality, ensuring that existing clients are not broken while providing cross-platform MCP capabilities.

## New Package Structure

```
@playground/
├── .                    # Main exports (UI components, experiments)
├── /mcp-server         # MCP server functionality (Next.js only)
└── /mcp-client         # MCP client functionality (web + React Native)
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **No Breaking Changes**

- Existing clients using `@playground` continue to work unchanged
- UI components and experiments remain accessible via main export
- No risk of MCP code interfering with existing functionality

### 2. **Platform-Specific Exports**

- **`@playground/mcp/server`**: Next.js/server-side only
- **`@playground/mcp-client`**: Cross-platform (web + React Native)
- **`@playground`**: Main playground functionality (UI components)

### 3. **Cross-Platform MCP Client**

- Works in both web and React Native environments
- Platform-agnostic transport layer (HTTP, stdio, SSE)
- Reusable client code across different platforms

## Usage Examples

### For Existing Clients (No Changes Needed)

```tsx
import { patternplayGreeting, Button } from "@playground";
// Everything works exactly as before
```

### For MCP Server (Next.js Only)

```tsx
import { getFAQ } from "@playground/mcp/server";
// Server-side MCP functionality
```

### For MCP Client (Web + React Native)

```tsx
import { createPlaygroundClient } from "@playground/mcp-client";
// Cross-platform MCP client
```

## Implementation Details

### MCP Server (`/mcp-server`)

- **Location**: `src/mcp-server/`
- **Purpose**: Server-side MCP tools and functionality
- **Platform**: Next.js only (not for React Native)
- **Features**: FAQ system, extensible tool framework
- **Exports**: `getFAQ()`, `getFAQText()`, `mcpFunctions`

### MCP Client (`/mcp-client`)

- **Location**: `src/mcp-client/`
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform MCP client implementation
- **Platform**: Web + React Native compatible
- **Features**: Multiple transport types, session management
- **Exports**: `PlaygroundMcpClient`, `createMcpClient()`, `createPlaygroundClient()`

### Main Playground (`.`)

- **Location**: `src/index.ts`
- **Purpose**: UI components and experiments (unchanged)
- **Platform**: Web/Next.js (as before)
- **Features**: UI components, pattern testing, demos
- **Exports**: `patternplayGreeting`, UI components from `@ui-web`

## Package.json Configuration

The package.json now includes separate export paths:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./src/index.ts",
      "import": "./src/index.ts"
    },
    "./mcp-server": {
      "types": "./src/mcp-server/index.ts",
      "import": "./src/mcp-server/index.ts"
    },
    "./mcp-client": {
      "types": "./src/mcp-client/index.ts",
      "import": "./src/mcp-client/index.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Existing Client Protection**

- Main export remains unchanged
- UI components continue to work as expected
- No MCP code is imported by default

### 2. **Platform Isolation**

- Server code is clearly marked as Next.js only
- Client code is designed for cross-platform use
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript support for all modules
- Clear interfaces and type definitions
- Compile-time error checking

## Validation

- ✅ **Type Check**: `pnpm type-check` passes
- ✅ **Build**: `pnpm build` completes successfully
- ✅ **Structure**: Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README files
- ✅ **Examples**: Usage examples for all modules

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Transport Implementation**

The MCP client currently has placeholder transport implementations. In production, you would:

- Implement actual HTTP transport for web
- Implement stdio transport for Node.js
- Implement SSE transport for real-time communication

### 2. **Error Handling**

- Add more sophisticated error handling
- Implement retry logic for failed connections
- Add connection pooling for multiple clients

### 3. **Testing**

- Add unit tests for all modules
- Add integration tests for client-server communication
- Add platform-specific tests for web and React Native

## Conclusion

The playground package now provides:

- **Safe MCP integration** without breaking existing clients
- **Cross-platform MCP client** for web and React Native
- **Server-side MCP tools** for Next.js applications
- **Clear separation** of concerns and platform boundaries
- **Comprehensive documentation** and usage examples

This structure follows MCP best practices while maintaining backward compatibility and enabling future cross-platform development.
