# @shredbx/reactbook v0.0.1

## What & Why

This package contains **ReactBookâ€™s reusable React code**.  
It is the foundation layer for React experiments, utilities, and components that power demos and knowledgebases.

## When to Use

- To build modular, composable React solutions
- To reuse React patterns across web and React Native apps
- As the code source for ReactBook-Web demonstrations

## When Not to Use

- For one-off prototypes without reusability in mind
- If the code is tightly coupled to a specific app only

## How It Works

- Provides modular React components and utilities
- Can be consumed by both **Next.js apps** and **React Native apps**
- Aligned with PatternBook methodology for documenting patterns

## Examples / Use-cases

- Zustand slice patterns shared across React Web + Native
- A reusable matrix component powering multiple demo apps
